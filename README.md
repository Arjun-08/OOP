# OOP Course: Blood Donation Application-weekend_OOP_hackathon

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a Blood Donation Application for an NGO called XYZ.

## Existing Manual Blood Donation System:

- Manual Process is too time-consuming, often leading to error-prone results.
- Lack of skilled resources to manage the existing application.
- Not enough data or lots of missing records in the existing system.
- Results are not accurate.

## Advantages of Building an Online Blood Donation System:

- Time Efficiency: Automation reduces data entry and processing time.
- Accuracy: Digital forms minimize human errors.
- Resource Optimization: Fewer skilled personnel needed for management.
- Comprehensive Data Management: Ensures complete and consistent data records.
- Real-time Access and Updates: Immediate data retrieval and updates.
- Enhanced Reporting and Analytics: Easy generation of reports and data analysis.
- Improved User Experience: Convenient online registration and notifications for donors.
- Security: Robust protection of sensitive donor information.
- Scalability: Accommodates growing user base and data volumes.
- Integration with Other Systems: Seamless coordination with other healthcare platforms.

## Project Overview

As part of the hackathon, a virtual backend application was developed using Python. This application collects input from users and stores the data in CSV files. No user interface or frontend development was involved in this project. The main aim of the hackathon was to focus on programming in Python and ensure that user data is correctly saved in a database.

## Repository Structure

- `Admin.py`: Python script for admin functionalities.
- `Projectcode.py`: Main Python script for the blood donation application.
- `details.py`: Python script containing details for the blood donation application.
- `user.py`: Python script for user functionalities.
- `ADMIN LOGIN DETAILS.txt`: File containing admin login details.
- `DONORS FILE DETAILS.txt`: File containing details of blood donors.
- `HOSPITALS DETAILS.txt`: File containing details of hospitals.
- `PATIENTS DETAILS.txt`: File containing details of patients.
- `USER LOGIN DETAILS.txt`: File containing user login details.
- `blood_request.txt`: File containing blood donation requests.

## Usage

To use the blood donation application, run the `Projectcode.py` script. Ensure that all necessary details are provided in the respective text files. Follow the instructions provided within the script for further guidance.
