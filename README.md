# OOP Course: Blood Donation Application-weekend_OOP_hackathon

Objective : To develop a Blood donation application for an NGO XYZ.

Existing Manual Blood donation system:
1. Manual Process is too time consuming, often leads to error prone
results
2. Lack of skilled resources to manage the existing application
3. Not enough data or lot of missing records in the existing system
4. Results are not accurate

Advantages of Building an Online Blood Donation System:

1. Time Efficiency: Automation reduces data entry and processing time.
2. Accuracy: Digital forms minimize human errors.
3. Resource Optimization: Fewer skilled personnel needed for management.
4. Comprehensive Data Management: Ensures complete and consistent data records.
5. Real-time Access and Updates: Immediate data retrieval and updates.
6. Enhanced Reporting and Analytics: Easy generation of reports and data analysis.
7. Improved User Experience: Convenient online registration and notifications for donors.
8. Security: Robust protection of sensitive donor information.
9. Scalability: Accommodates growing user base and data volumes.
10. Integration with Other Systems: Seamless coordination with other healthcare platforms.
    
As part of the hackathon, we developed a virtual backend application using Python. This application collects input from users and stores the data in CSV files. There is no user interface or frontend development involved in this project. The main aim of the hackathon is to focus on programming in Python and ensure that user data is correctly saved in a database.
